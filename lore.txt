===================================================
There is a place, beneath those ancient ruins, 
in the moor, that calls out to the boldest among
them... "We are the Flame!" they cry,"And Darkness
fears us!" They descend, spurred on by fantasies
of riches and redemption, to lay bare whatever 
blasphemous abnormality may slumber restlessly
in that unholy abyss... But Darkness is insidious.
Terror and Madness can find cracks in the sturdiest
of armors, the most resolute of minds... And below,
in that limitless chasm of Chaos, they will realize
the truth of it. "We are not the Flame!" they will
cry out, "We are but moths and we are DOOMED!" And
their screams will echo amidst the pitiless
cyclopean stones... Of the Darkest Dungeon.
